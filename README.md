# Procedural Dungeon Generator

Went about seeking a simple way of doing procedural generation for a dungeon crawler. My research led me to this really nifty solution by SilverlyBee. ->
[Procedural Dungeon Generator in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHU5RQWbmWE) 

## Prerequisites

The modular dungeon art we use is created by the very talented Luther S. Schmidt(L2S ARTS). Link to the asset provided here, since we don't include it in the project files ->
[Stylized Hand Painted Dungeon (Free)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/stylized-hand-painted-dungeon-free-173934)

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the Unity project in Unity Editor.
3. Import and relink the art asset from the link provided, or provide your own alternative.
4. Just hit play in the SampleScene to test the generator.
   
## Usage

1. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies and art assets relinked.
4. Inside the project, once you've launched the scene, find the Generator gameobject.
5. Once you've found this object, go to the attached script, and play with the element values to get desired room spawn results.

## Sidenote

This is something i worked on back at the start of 2021. It's a very small system demo. Decided to upload it to GitHub since i liked its simplicity; that paired with having it on hand for future reference. 

## Demo

Check out the project demo on YouTube:
